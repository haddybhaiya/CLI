/**
 * Create the branch, and if the request fails ambiguously at the transport or
 * gateway layer, check whether it was created anyway before giving up.
 *
 * `createBranchApi` carries no idempotency key, and a reset on the RESPONSE leg
 * leaves a fully created, billing branch behind while the CLI exits non-zero.
 * The caller then has no id, no name in the output, and no reason to believe
 * anything exists — so the branch is silently orphaned. `branch list` is
 * authoritative here, and it is a control-plane call, so it still works while
 * the branch's own host is unreachable.
 *
 * Two guards keep this from adopting something it did not create — a duplicate
 * name is a REJECTION, not an ambiguous failure, and adopting on it would
 * switch the caller into someone else's branch with a different mode and
 * different data:
 *
 *   1. only a tagged transport failure or a 502/503/504 gateway failure is
 *      eligible; other HTTP/API rejections (duplicate name, quota, auth)
 *      rethrow untouched;
 *   2. the branch must have been created at or after the moment we sent the
 *      request, so a pre-existing same-name branch is never a candidate;
 *   3. the branch's mode must match what we asked for.
 *
 * Guard 3 narrows a residual collision the timestamp window alone cannot close:
 * a collaborator creating a same-name branch inside the skew window, at the same
 * moment our own request loses its response leg, would otherwise be adoptable —
 * and with the default `--switch` that would silently move local context onto
 * their branch. Requiring a mode match makes that require an even more specific
 * coincidence (same name AND same mode AND the same ~60s AND our transport
 * or gateway failure). The real fix is a server-issued idempotency/request token
 * on `createBranchApi`; until that exists, this is the tightest client-side
 * guard.
 * Reported upstream: InsForge/InsForge#1790.
 *
 * When no matching branch turns up, the original error is rethrown unchanged —
 * so guard 1 accepting proxy statuses cannot mask a request the backend never
 * acted on.
 *
 * Deliberately NARROWER than `isTransientApiError`, which the poll uses:
 *   - 500 is excluded. That is the application's own answer, so it is more
 *     likely an authoritative rejection than a lost response, and adopting on
 *     it would widen the window in which a collaborator's same-name branch
 *     could be picked up and switched into (the residual collision above).
 *     Re-reading a status after a 500 is free; adopting after one is not.
 *   - 408/429 are excluded. A rate limit or a timeout on the POST means the
 *     request was refused, not lost — nothing was created to adopt.
